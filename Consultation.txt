*priority is full of existing employees
*library has the list of employees
*queue<employee> has a list of the employees from library
*pop - finds highest priority instead of push, because changes in push and make it inefficient
queue<employee> should be a queue with pointers to employee, so queue<employee>
*pass_on - gives to the next employee obviously
*retaining and waiting times are cumulative, so we won't need separate retaining and waiting times for each employee
